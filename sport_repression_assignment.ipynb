    "* H1: In the run-up to an international sports tournament, state repression spikes in host cities, but not in other cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* H2: During an international sports tourna- ment, state repression drops in host cities but remains unchanged in other cities.\n",

    "You understand that this is an individual assignment, and as such you must carry it out alone. You may seek help on the Internet, by Googling or searching in StackOverflow for general questions pertaining to the use of Python,  libraries, and idioms. However, it is not right to ask direct questions that relate to the assignment and where people will actually solve your problem by answering them. You may discuss with your fellow students in order to better understand the questions, if they are not clear enough, but you should not ask them to share their answers with you, or to help you by giving specific advice."
